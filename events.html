						<h2>Hal-Con</h2>
						<p>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/Halcon.png" alt="" /></span> This year (2024) I was able to go to Halcon for the first time. I wasn't sure what to expect out of it but it ended up being a lot of fun. I didn't bring anything with me to showcase or get feedback from passerby and I do regret that. I was however able to meet other people in the field, including some folks from ISNS as well as some past students from the Game Programming course and I was able to have some cool conversations with them.
							I'm hoping to go again next year and I'll be sure to have something ready to bring with me so I can show it off to people passing by as well as get some feedback from them as well.

						<h2>Global Game Jam 2025</h2>
						<p>
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/globalgamejam.png" alt="" /></span> I participated as a Lead programmer/Level Designer for the global game jam this year to create the game "Boba Bounce". I designed and created the 3 main levels in the game as well as coded different mechanics for each level such as a jump pad and lava-like fields. The event was a great time as I got to meet a ton of other aspiring game developers and have conversations with them about the sort of
							things they've been working on.
